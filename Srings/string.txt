It is a class(non primitive data type)
Immutable
Domo d= new Demo(); //new used to allocate memory in heap

class Demo{
    int a;
    int b;
    static int c;
    static int d;
}

2 ways to create object for string
 1)String s="hello"; //s is reffernce variable,  String is a type
   Sting s1="hello";
        They are same so there are no different memory they are stored in same  one location;
        the s1 and s have same memory address;  they are stored in scp(string constant pool)
2)String str1=new String("hello");
